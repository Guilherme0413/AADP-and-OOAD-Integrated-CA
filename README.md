Following the success of YouTube Movies, RTÉ is seeking to add movie rental functionality, ÉirVid, to its video streaming service, RTÉ Player. RTÉ has signed a contract with your team to design and write a prototype of this service. You will be combining skills from two of the classes that you have this semester, to design and implement a Java program that will provide all of the functionality of the system described below.

ÉirVid will need to:
● Allow users to create and log into accounts with an email and a password.
● Allow a user to rent a movie.
● Movies and their prices will initially be provided in a csv file.
● For this prototype: when a customer is charged, output the customer, movie, and price to the console.
● A GUI is *NOT* allowed (No Swing, JavaFX etc).
● For this prototype, rental duration is 1 minute for each movie.
● Keep track of what movies a user has rented.
● Recommend to users the 5 most rented movies of the past 5 minutes.
